## The Vision

In today’s data-driven world, **every organization is sitting on untapped insights** hidden within rows of spreadsheets and .csv files. But not every stakeholder is a data scientist.

**Universal LLM Copilot** bridges that gap.

Imagine uploading any dataset — sales, healthcare, cybersecurity, finance — and getting:
- Clean, structured data
- Clear visualizations and dashboards
- Trained machine learning models
- AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Natural language Q&A over your own data
- A professional PDF report you can present to stakeholders

All in minutes. All automated.
